# How to model plume top.  Choices are:
#     Briggs -- use the Briggs equation for plume top
#     FEPS -- use the simplistic FEPS equation for plume top (2 * plume_bot)
#     auto -- use the Briggs equation unless the result would be smaller than
#             the plume bottom, in which case use the FEPS equation
